# ABCpy 

ABCpy is a scientific library for approaximate Bayesian computation (ABC)
written in Python. It addresses the needs of domain scientists and data
scientists by providing

* a fully modularized framework that is easy to use and easy to extend, and
* a non-intrusive, user-friendly way to parallelize inference computations

## Main Features

* Quickly infer parameters for already existing models
* Quickly integrate your model into the framework
* Easily parallelize the inferrence computation when models become complex
